# AML Transaction Monitoring Simulation

## Project Overview
This project simulates an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) transaction monitoring system to identify potential suspicious activities in banking transactions. The project demonstrates key AML concepts including structuring detection, high-risk jurisdiction monitoring, and rapid movement of funds.

## Key Features
- Synthetic transaction data generation with realistic patterns
- Detection of common AML red flags:
  - Structuring (multiple deposits under reporting thresholds)
  - Rapid movement of funds between accounts
  - Transactions involving high-risk jurisdictions
  - Unusual transaction patterns
- Automated alert generation
- Manual investigation report templates
- Statistical analysis of transaction patterns

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Faker)
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis
- Markdown for documentation
